# Rust Bot

![](https://github.com/Yamboy1/rust_bot/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

A discord bot written in rust. This project is basically just me playing around with rust, while also trying to make a functional discord bot. The bot uses serenity, but I'm making my own command framework / parser for it.
